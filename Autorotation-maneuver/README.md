<b>About the mod</b>

The script will add the ability to perform the autorotation maneuver, allowing you, if done correctly, to perform an emergency landing in any vehicle with rotary wings. 

I made this script for the simple reason that it makes no sense that I could survive the impact of a missile fired at the rear of my helicopter, but die trying to land it. Now I managed to land the whole helicopter and as a bonus blow up the bastard that hit me using the portable missile launcher.
